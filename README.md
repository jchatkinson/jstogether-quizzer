# jstogether-quizzer
A simple (ugly?) quiz application that asks questions and generates a score

Built for Project 0 of /r/jstogether https://www.reddit.com/r/jstogether/comments/3fr1ai/project_0_quiz_app/


## Ideas for improvements
* ~~An even bigger picture of Alex Trebek~~
* ~~figure out a way around CORS issue with jservice api~~
* present the questions in a more fun manner (maybe some animations)
* style the questions to look more like the jeopardy board
* misc polishing / css work
* Some more user-settings like number of questions, difficulty, etc
